Development Points mod that is modified to be compatible with Expanded mod Family ( https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1626860092 ) and Europa Expanded ( https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2164202838 ).

For the minimal setup you need at least the following mods:
- Europa Expanded
- Trade Goods Expanded (from Expanded mod Family)
- Flavour and Events Expanded (from Expanded mod Family)

The mods above are added as required dependencies to steam workshop item.

Confirmed to be working with all mods from Expanded mod Family and Europa Expanded as of 29/09/2024. 

Note that Europa Expanded and Expanded mod Family may have incompatibilities, I have another mod that fixes some of them: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3307176154 
I didn't add this mod as a required dependency because it's possible that EE and Expanded mod Family will fix those incompatibilities in future, however I do recommend using it as of 29/09/2024.
